# NBA Salary vs Performance Dashboard 🏀

An interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing the relationship between NBA player salaries and on-court performance across 3 seasons (2022-2025).

**Key Question:** Are NBA teams getting value for their money?

## Live Dashboards

- **[Dashboard 2 - Advanced Salary Analytics](https://public.tableau.com/views/NBASalaryPerformancedash2/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**

### Dashboard 1: Player Performance Analysis

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides five interactive views to analyze player value:

1. **Executive Overview** - League-wide salary and performance metrics with interactive filters
2. **Salary Distribution** - Visual breakdown of how money is distributed across players
3. **Performance vs Salary** - Scatter plot revealing the correlation (or lack thereof) between pay and production
4. **Team Payroll Comparison** - Compare how all 30 teams spend their money and perform
5. **Trade & Free Agency Intel** - Identify which players to sign, trade away, pursue, or watch

## What This Project Does

This project builds a complete data pipeline that:

1. **Extracts** player statistics from the NBA API and Basketball Reference (web scraping)
2. **Extracts** salary data from HoopsHype (web scraping)
3. **Stores** all data in a MySQL database
4. **Transforms** raw data using Python scripts to calculate efficiency metrics
5. **Exports** clean CSV files for Tableau visualization
6. **Visualizes** insights through an interactive dashboard

## Data Sources

### Player Statistics
- **NBA API** (`nba_api` Python library) - Basic stats (PPG, RPG, APG, shooting percentages)
- **Basketball Reference** (web scraping) - Advanced metrics (VORP, Win Shares, BPM, PER)

### Salary Data
- **HoopsHype** (web scraping) - Player salaries for 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25 seasons

### Coverage
- **1,844** player-season records
- **622** unique players with salary data (80.78% coverage)
- **3** NBA seasons

## Pipeline Architecture

```
NBA API + Web Scraping → MySQL Database → Python ETL Scripts → CSV Files → Tableau Dashboard
```

**Key Scripts:**
- `import_merged_stats.py` - Load player stats into MySQL
- `prepare_tableau_data.py` - Transform data and export 5 CSV files for Tableau

**CSV Outputs:**
- `tableau_main_dashboard.csv` - Complete player stats (1,844 records)
- `tableau_team_summary.csv` - Team aggregations (95 records)
- `tableau_player_comparison.csv` - Year-over-year changes (1,852 records)
- `tableau_value_analysis.csv` - Efficiency metrics (1,402 records)
- `tableau_position_analysis.csv` - Position averages (15 records)

## Key Insights

What the dashboard reveals:

- **Salary ≠ Performance**: Only 35-45% of performance variance is explained by salary
- **Hidden Gems Exist**: Many low-salary players ($5-12M) deliver exceptional value
- **Overpaid Players**: The $18-25M salary range often yields the worst value
- **Elite Players Are Worth It**: Top performers with max contracts justify their pay
- **Position Economics**: Combo guards and stretch bigs provide best value; traditional centers are often overpaid

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Python 3.8+** | Data extraction and transformation |
| **nba_api** | NBA statistics API |
| **Pandas & NumPy** | Data manipulation |
| **MySQL 8.0** | Database storage |
| **Tableau Desktop** | Interactive visualizations |
| **Web Scraping** | Salary and advanced metrics collection |


## Project Files

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - This file
- `TABLEAU_QUICK_START.md` - Quick setup guide

**Scripts:**
- `import_merged_stats.py` - Import stats to database
- `prepare_tableau_data.py` - Generate Tableau datasets
- `setup_database.sql` - MySQL schema

**Data Files:**
- `tableau_*.csv` - 5 Tableau-ready datasets (generated by scripts)
- `nba_merged_stats_*.csv` - Raw merged statistics
- `nba_player_salaries_*.csv` - Raw salary data

## Database Schema

**Main Tables:**
- `player_merged_stats` - Comprehensive player statistics
- `player_salaries` - Salary information
- `player_profiles` - Player biographical data
- `team_payroll` - Team-level salary aggregations

**Views:**
- `player_complete_view` - Joins stats with salaries, calculates efficiency metrics
- `team_performance_view` - Team-level aggregations

## Calculated Metrics

The Python scripts calculate value metrics including:

- **Points per Million** = PPG / (Salary / 1,000,000)
- **Salary per Win Share** = Salary / Win Shares
- **Salary per VORP** = Salary / Value Over Replacement
- **Value Score** = (VORP × 1,000,000) / Salary × 100
- **Value Categories** = "Hidden Gem", "Good Value", "Overpaid", etc.

## Dashboard Use Cases

**For NBA Front Offices:**
- Identify undervalued free agents to sign
- Find overpaid players to trade away
- Evaluate trade proposals objectively
- Compare team payroll efficiency

**For Analysts:**
- Research salary-performance correlations
- Analyze position-based value trends
- Track player improvement year-over-year
- Study team roster construction strategies

**For Fans:**
- See if your team is spending wisely
- Find breakout players before they get expensive
- Understand which contracts are good/bad
- Compare player value across the league


## Notes

- **Data Coverage:** 80.78% of players have salary data. Missing data primarily affects G-League, two-way contracts, and minimal playing time players.
- **Rate Limiting:** NBA API calls are rate-limited to respect usage guidelines
- **Name Matching:** Fuzzy matching handles abbreviated names and Jr./Sr. suffixes
